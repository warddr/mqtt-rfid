"""
This is the server code, which retrieves the messages from the MQTT server, send from the ESP32 with its RFID reader.
Every student has its own Topic to publish the messages to. The server subscribes to the "AP/rfid/lezer/<student id>/+"
topic. When the ESP32 publishes messages to it, it will parse the message (only retrieve first line) and store it
in its sqlite3 database.
The server sends back the number of messages it has received from that card UID on the topic AP/rfid/deur/<student id>.

The message is the username or user identity on the card
